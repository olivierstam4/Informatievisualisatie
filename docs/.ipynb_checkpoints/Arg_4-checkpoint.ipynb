    "In this graph we see that 20 years ago countries with a low GDP(Gross Domestic Product) had less industrial productions. Countries with medium or high GDP both had high amounts of industry. These countries saw very little growth over the next 15 years, In contrast the lower GDP countries had lots of industrial improvements. Around 2016 The low GDP countries even overtook the production of total industry of the high GDP countries. A possible reason for this is that it became more expensive to do industrial tasks in higher GDP countries so companies chose to build their factories in lower GDP countries.\n",
